# fastmail-rules

Random collection of things that generate Fastmail rules in JSON format from
various sources, for easy import into Fastmail.

The whole repo is a quick and dirty hack for my own personal use, and I have no
plans to make any of this user-friendly. If you want to know what it does, just
poke around the source code :)
